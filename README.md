# 3D Renderer Frontend

This project is a basic 3D renderer developed in F# as part of the course **CGT 58100-016** at Purdue University. The project was completed by **Aadhav Subramanian** and **Vinayak Regmi**.

## 📦 Features
- **Viewport:** Allows for camera movement and object inspection within the scene.
- **Inspector:** Displays and allows modification of object attributes such as position, rotation, and scale.
- **Importer:** Enables importing of 3D models with associated textures.
- **Debug Panel:** Logs runtime information such as FPS, camera position, and object states.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- F# for the application logic.
- Windows Forms for the UI components.
- Native bindings for rendering and object manipulation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chux-Padaina/3D_Renderer_Frontend.git
   cd 3D_Renderer_Frontend
   ```

2. Open the solution in **Rider** or **Visual Studio**.

3. Build the solution and run the main program.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **ViewerPanel.fs** - Main viewport and camera controls.
- **InspectorPanel.fs** - Inspector panel logic.
- **ImporterPanel.fs** - Model importing logic.
- **LogPanel.fs** - Logging and debug utilities.

## 📢 Acknowledgments
This project is a coursework submission for CGT 58100-016 at Purdue University under the guidance of the course instructors.
